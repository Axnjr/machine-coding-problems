Portfolio Tracker Tool 

This document explains the requirements of the portfolio tracking tool 
 Definitions 
Securities: A simple definition of a security is any proof of ownership or debt that has been assigned a value and may be sold. Example - Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCS) one of the companies which became public in 2004 and investors can buy and sell shares of TCS. Currently the price of 1 share (can call it quantity also) of TCS is Rs. 1,843.45. All the information is publicly available. Other listed companies - WIPRO (Wipro Limited), GODREJIND (Godrej Industries Ltd). 
Ticker Symbol: Every listed security has a unique ticker symbol, facilitating the vast array of trade orders that flow through the financial markets every day. Example - ticker for Tata Consultancy Services Limited is TCS, for Wipro Limited it is WIPRO. 
Portfolio: A portfolio is a grouping of securities with the average buy price & their quantities. Example - Suppose following securities are bought - 
Ticker symbol 
Average Buy Price 
Shares
TCS 
1,833.45 
5
WIPRO 
319.25 
10
GODREJIND 
535.00 
2

Suppose 5 more shares of GODREJIND are bought at Rs 400 (this is called placing a trade in the security). Now portfolio will look like -
Ticker symbol 
Average Buy Price 
Shares
TCS 
1,833.45 
5
WIPRO 
319.25 
10


GODREJIND 
(535*2 + 400*5)/(5 + 2) 
7



Observe carefully how the price of GODREJIND is a weighted average of previous average buy price and the current trade price. 
Now suppose if 5 shares of WIPRO are sold (again by placing a trade), the portfolio will look like 
Ticker symbol 
Average Buy Price 
Shares
TCS 
1,833.45 
5
WIPRO 
319.25 
5
GODREJIND 
438.57 
7

Observe carefully how the average price doesn’t change after selling off a few securities. This is because selling affects your returns, not the average price of the stocks bought. 
Application Requirements - 
Implement a library/module which allows adding of trades, deploy holdings and can do basic return calculations etc. For simplicity, assume there is only one user who can have a single portfolio. Basic functionality includes - 
- Adding trades for security, and updating the portfolio accordingly.
> add_trade(ticker, price, shares, “trade_type”)

> “5 shares bought/sold for TCS at 1500”  

- Fetching holdings: It is an aggregate view of all securities in the portfolio with its final  quantity and average buy price


> fetch_holdings()


> TCS: 10@Rs.1500 INFY: 20@Rs1100 RELIANCE: 7@Rs1000. 

- Fetching returns: This is something new which needs explanation. Please refer to the final table above after we place sell orders for WIPRO. This API call should respond with cumulative returns at any point of time of a particular portfolio. Formula for calculating cumulative returns is: 
SUM((CURRENT_PRICE[ticker] - AVERAGE_BUY_PRICE[ticker]) * 
CURRENT_QUANTITY[ticker]) 

So in the example, cumulative returns will be, (1843.45 - 1833.45) * 5 + (329.25 - 319.25) * 5 + (535.00 - 438.57) * 7 = Rs. 775.01. Since in API you don’t have access to the current price of any security, please assume the current price is always Rs. 100 for any security.
> fetch_returns()


> Rs.775

Expectations from the Implementation: 
1. Validations like “quantity of a stock should always be positive” should be in place. 
2. The code should be clean, loosely coupled and OO/functional.
3. Ensure appropriate exception handling.
4. Use the application’s memory for any storage requirements.
